Question 4:

    I have been learning web development since past 2 years and have created multiple projects 
    when I learn something new. I have created a Full Stack Web App named "Sangeet" which combinely
    uses ReactJS as Frontend and ExpressJS as Backend. It uses PostgreSQL from RDS Database service 
    from AWS. It is also hosted on AWS EC2 Instance "https://sangeet.tech/"

Question 5:
    
    I would go for such guys who have a foundational technical knowledge as well as can connect
    to people in ease way. Also if any have one have knowledge related to business would be much 
    better as it can help a lot in case of a startup. A guy who can take responsibilty for the
    business management and can handle all the investors related queries and other who is good in
    terms of technical knowledge and can provide solutions to the required problems faced.
